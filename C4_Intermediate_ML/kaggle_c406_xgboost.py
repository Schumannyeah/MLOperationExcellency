# Gradient BoostingÂ¶
# Gradient boosting is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.
#
# It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive.
# (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)

# Parameter Tuning
# XGBoost has a few parameters that can dramatically affect accuracy and training speed. The first parameters you should understand are:
#
# n_estimators
# n_estimators specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above.
# It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.
#
# Too low a value causes underfitting, which leads to inaccurate predictions on both training data and test data.
# Too high a value causes overfitting, which causes accurate predictions on training data,
# but inaccurate predictions on test data (which is what we care about).
# Typical values range from 100-1000, though this depends a lot on the learning_rate parameter discussed below.

# early_stopping_rounds
# early_stopping_rounds offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators.
# Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving,
# even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators. It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and
# then use early_stopping_rounds to find the optimal time to stop iterating.
#
# Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve,
# you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping.
# Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.
#
# When using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores
# - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.

# learning_rate
# Instead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model,
# we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.
#
# This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting.
# If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.
#
# In general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models,
# though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle.
# As default, XGBoost sets learning_rate=0.1.
